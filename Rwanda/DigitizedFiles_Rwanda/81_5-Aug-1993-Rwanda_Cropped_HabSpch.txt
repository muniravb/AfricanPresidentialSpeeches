Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the Arusha negotiations are hereby crowned with the signing of the peace agreement. This is a key and decisive step.

But we are still left with the most important thing. Total commitment is required from each one of us. It will be necessary to ensure that the peace agreement is respected. It will be necessary to change our behavior. It will be necessary for all of us as Rwandans, wherever we are, to shed feelings of revenge and antagonism. It will be necessary to heal our wounds, especially those in our hearts, in order to look to the future with confidence in the prosperity of our country.

We have just signed the peace agreement. Each Rwandan will find in it their deepest aspirations: Real peace, the tranquillity which is their legitimate right, and their security which can no longer be alienated. The agreement is the result of a compromise. Everyone has something to lose in it. However, and this is most important, beyond individual and partisan interests, each Rwandan must believe that they have won something in the agreement. This is because the agreement must banish for ever the sufferings experienced by Rwanda, particularly since 1 October 1990. 

I take this opportunity to launch an urgent and solemn appeal to the international community for help to our country in the form of a special assistance program for the reconstruction of Rwanda. We thank in advance all donors who will provide generous assistance for national reconstruction.

We Are Building Our Boat To Cross the River of Poverty

We have no reason to feel suspicious toward our neighbors. Uganda, which is also a landlocked country, faces problems similar to ours. General Amin has taken certain steps In his country on which I can pass no judgment and which can probably be justified by the fact that he himself is confronted with difficulties. For instance, he stopped all night road traffic for domestic security reasons. The previously existing supply system has been thrown into confusion as a result. We now have to go as far as Mombasa (a Kenyan port about 1,500 km away) to get our supplies, which are brought by road

Faced with these problems, therefore, I stated in a speech that desperate diseases require desperate remedies, That Is why I created the stabilization committee, I have given full powers to this committee, of which I am chairman. Naturally, we have other organizations (the Politburo, the Executive Council and so forth) but the stabilization committee has full powers to act at any time, seek solutions to the present crisis and abolish moot non essential imports, I have also set up a production committee to try to increase production, to make an effort in other fields and to export as much as possible. We have also taken certain measures concerning wages, including wage cuts. In sum, we have taken many measures through the stabilization committee and you will be hearing about some of them shortly, particularly the results of the talks which we have had with the International Monetary Fund.

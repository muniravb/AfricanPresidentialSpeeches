President Habyarimana stated on Tuesday that Rwanda cannot definitively resettle in its territory all the refugees who have just come from Uganda.

In a speech delivered on the 22nd anniversary of the Rwanda Armed Forces, the head of state remarked that his country and Uganda "have excellent relations of friendship, solidarity and brotherhood." However, In these circumstances, he added, "both countries must show their geniune determination to carry out a policy of neighborliness on which their development and the security of their respective peoples are dependent."

The Rwandan head of state went on to say: "I entertain the hope that Rwanda's proposals will receive our partner's attention and understanding in strict compliance with international regulations and our mutual, legitimate interests."

Expressing his "greatest concern" about the massive influx of refugees from Uganda, the president thanked "all those who assist in this situation, which is particularly difficult for a country listed among the least developed In the world."

"Rwanda's exiguous territory, its population explosion, and its dramatically slender means would not enable it to receive, maintain and give shelter to a large number of people," he added.

Finally, President Habyarlmana made an appeal to all to ensure that persons without shelter or freedom, and wandering all over Africa, the Middle East and everywhere else in the world, will no longer be left to their own fate and at destiny's mercy.

[Text] Dear brothers and sisters, there are not many of you out there today, but we are with our sons and grandsons, [applause] You have just asked me to run for a seventh term. It will be, I am telling you, my last one [shouts from the audience: It will not, it will not]. I agree to your request—if each of you makes it easier for me—in these times of hardship, if each of you makes it easier for me to make each day, even for a short time, much more and better for the country. [Applause]

I expect from you the tighest unity, mutual trust, effective solidarity, but above all—our joint asset, my legacy, the one I want to leave to you when I step down, our most precious treasury—peace, [applause] Peace of heart and mind, peace in your daily dealings. Peace. One day, in the Third French Republic, a brilliant minister, Aristide Briand declared war on war. Today, because I trust you, I dare declare peace for Ivory Coast, Africa, and, why not, for this troubled world. Together, we can wiïi this last

battle with the tighest unity among all the sons of this country. Those who left are like birds who flew from the tree, they will fly back, [applause] I do not want to say much more on this. I am very moved, happy, and proud to see these young people, our reason for living, freely create study groups. Since action is at the basis of everything, I will ask all of you to turn these study groups into action clubs [applause] for the development of a nicer, more prosperous, and united country. With God’s help, we will turn it into the beacon of Africa, a continent which has been laboring to achieve equality with other countries. It has the means, raw materials, and human resources ready to be put to use so as to catch up with the others through hard word and love. God is love. Thank you.

Still on developments in Cote d'Ivoire. All these pressures from France, the United States, and even from some regional countries explain perhaps the very conciliatory tone of the speech made by President Gbagbo on 9 October.

The president came out as reassuring, specially with regard to foreign nationals, in his speech which was broadcast on the national radio and television stations. As you are aware, several neighbouring countries have complained about abuses and harassment targeting their nationals living in Cote d'Ivoire.

The issue is particularly sensitive in Burkina Faso, as citizens from this country living in Cote d'Ivoire are quite numerous. And it seems that the speech made by the Ivorian president was somewhat reassuring for Burkinabes. Alpha Barry reports.

Barry President Gbagbo' speech in which he called on his compatriots not to attack foreigners was viewed as reassuring by Burkinab√©s who have been particularly worried about their relatives in Cote d'Ivoire. Gbagbo has finally understood that foreigners have nothing to do with this inter-Ivorian crisis, said the presenter of the state-owned television yesterday.

But the Burkinabe government, which took a tougher stand vis-a-vis Abidjan on 7 October, has not officially reacted to the speech. Although the Ivorian crisis was on the agenda of yesterday's cabinet meeting, the communique released by the government spokesman did not mention it. However, ministers expressed freely their opinion behind the scenes. One has to wait and see the real impact of the Ivorian president's speech in the field.

Meanwhile, we should not lower our guard, said a cabinet minister. In plain language, this means that troops deployed a few days ago at the border with Cote d'Ivoire must stand ready to organize the evacuation of Burkina Faso nationals if harassment of foreigners was to continue.
